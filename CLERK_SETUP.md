# Clerk Authentication Setup

This project now uses Clerk for authentication. To complete the setup:

## 1. Create a Clerk Account
1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create an account
2. Create a new application

## 2. Get Your API Keys ✅ COMPLETED
1. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Copy the Publishable Key and Secret Key

## 3. Update Environment Variables ✅ COMPLETED
The `.env.local` file has been updated with your actual Clerk keys:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YXNzdXJlZC1mYXduLTc0LmNsZXJrLmFjY291bnRzLmRldiQ
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_gsyOTFsBqKI9e6mPhADhZI2yd2f41h6bY6QN926NRW
```

## 4. Configure Sign-in/Sign-up URLs (Optional)
You can customize the sign-in and sign-up experience by updating these variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```
